## Project Definition:
<b>“E Music Shop”</b> is an application which offers users to buy songs and full albums in an electronic format. The <b>Catalog MS</b> is storing all songs and albums that the application is providing, and it has all the CRUD functionalities. The <b>Shopping Cart MS</b> is storing all the order items that the user has chosen. All CRUD functionalities are also available here for better order and product management. The <b>Payment MS</b> is in charge of payments of the user orders, meaning, it stores and manages all the transactions the user has made for orders. The <b>Order MS</b> is storing the information about all the user orders in the application. The <b>User MS</b> is used for user management, authentication and authorization.
<br/> <br/>
The framework used to implement the system is <b>Flask</b>, along with <b>Python</b> as a main programming language, authorization implemented with <b>JWT tokens</b>, <b>SQL Alchemy</b> as a database server, <b>Consul</b> as a microservice discovery tool, and <b>Docker / Docker Compose</b> for deployment and containerization.
